# Chest-X-ray Classification for Pneumonia Detection using Xception
This repository presents a deep learning solution for the automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Developed as part of an academic initiative in medical image analysis, the project was completed under the guidance of Dr. Piyush Kumar Yadav, whose mentorship was invaluable throughout the research and development process.

Project Motivation and Objective<br>
Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making early and accurate diagnosis critical. Traditional radiographic interpretation is time-consuming and subject to human error, particularly in high-volume clinical environments. This project aims to leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assist radiologists by providing a reliable, automated classification of chest X-rays as either Normal or Pneumonia. By doing so, it supports more efficient and consistent diagnostic workflows.

Dataset and Problem Framing
The dataset comprises 5,216 chest X-ray images, divided into two categories: Normal (1,341 images) and Pneumonia (3,875 images). The data was organized into training, validation, and test sets, with each subset structured into class-specific directories to streamline loading and augmentation. Given the binary nature of the classification task, the model was trained to minimize binary cross-entropy loss and maximize accuracy. All images were resized to a standard input shape (224x224 pixels) to ensure consistency.

Preprocessing Pipeline
A robust preprocessing pipeline was implemented to enhance model generalization and performance. Images were normalized to the $$0, 1] pixel value range, facilitating faster convergence and reducing the impact of lighting variations. The training set underwent augmentation-including random rotations, horizontal flips, zooms, and shifts-to increase data diversity and reduce overfitting. Validation and test images were only rescaled, ensuring that evaluation metrics reflect real-world performance.

Model Choice: Why Xception?
The Xception architecture was selected for its proven balance of accuracy and computational efficiency in medical image classification tasks. Xception replaces traditional convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions, enabling the model to extract robust features while maintaining a manageable parameter count. This approach has demonstrated superior performance compared to other CNN architectures in several medical imaging benchmarks.

Transfer learning was employed by initializing the Xception model with pre-trained ImageNet weights, allowing the network to leverage rich feature representations learned from a large and diverse dataset. The modelâ€™s classification head was customized with fully connected layers and dropout for regularization, culminating in a sigmoid-activated output for binary classification.

Training Strategy
Model training utilized TensorFlow and Keras, with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Two key callbacks were integrated:

EarlyStopping to halt training if validation loss plateaued, preventing overfitting.

ModelCheckpoint to save the best-performing model based on validation metrics.

Training and validation accuracy and loss were monitored and visualized to assess learning dynamics and convergence.

Evaluation and Results
The trained model was evaluated on the test set using a comprehensive suite of metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. These metrics provide a holistic assessment of diagnostic performance, crucial in medical contexts where minimizing false negatives is vital. Visualizations-including sample predictions and confusion matrices-were generated to further interpret model behavior. Recent studies have shown that Xception-based models can achieve high accuracy and robust generalization in similar medical imaging tasks.
